# Custom Program for OOP University Class


the below text is taken from my milestone submittion:

>The program is a system that allows for employees to view their work schedules, and more importantly their payhistory and payslips. Users should be able to see their worked shifts, and also be able to see their weekly paycheck, based on the shifts they worked, including bonuses. There should also be a login system, witch allows for several degrees of privilege escalation. Lowest (employee) can only view their own data. A Manager can view their data, as well as relevant data of the employees that work under them. And a Master Admin can view all data for all employees and managers, and change properties of each user. Each employee has their own encrypted username and password. All data is saved to an encrypted csv file, saved locally on the device. This csv file can only be accessed through the application, or with the correct logins.



## what i learnt:

follow a structure when programming. something like this:
1.create branch
2.create method
3.create test for method and ensure it works
4.test other tests that use the new method
5.merge
